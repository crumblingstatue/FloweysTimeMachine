    <h3>Using external tool</h3>
    <p>
      If you wish to temporarily try out a save, you can use the third party
      tool
      <a href="https://github.com/LEGOlord208/UndertaleSandbox" target="_blank"
        >UndertaleSandbox</a
      >. Please note that we are in <b>no way</b> related to them, or any of
      their actions. If you wish to learn the manual way of installing, carry on
      with the tutorial!
    </p>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
      First, you need to find your Undertale save folder. This is usually
      <code>C:/Users/username/AppData/Local/UNDERTALE</code>, but it might be
      different for you, who knows. It should contain at least a file called
      <code>undertale.ini</code> and a file called <code>file0</code>, unless
      you haven't saved your game yet, or the save was deleted.
    </p>
    <h3>Loading</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have found where your existing save data is, you can load it into
      Flowey's time machine to edit it. You don't have to load an existing save
      though you can select a preset instead at the top, or use the default
      preset which is set by default.
    </p>
    <h3>Editing</h3>
    <p>
      Just edit the various fields to your liking. Some fields have a [?] next
      to them, you can hover over that with the mouse to get some information
      about the field.
    </p>
    <h3>Saving</h3>
    <p>
      Once you have edited the data to your liking, you can save it using the
      save button. Just overwrite your existing file0 and undertale.ini.
    </p>
    <h3>Undoing genocide erased world / selling your soul</h3>
    <p>
      If you erased your world, you should see a file called
      <code>system_information_962</code>. <br />If you sold your soul, you
      should also see a file called <code>system_information_963</code>.
      <br />Just delete these files using your file manager. If you are using
      the Steam version of the game, these files might be backed up and restored
      by the game on startup. In that case, you should delete the Steam data for
      UNDERTALE in addition to the system_ files, but I have no information on
      how to do this.
